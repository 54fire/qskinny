- Layouts

There are no spacing/stretch getters for spacer items
The initial spacings/margins have to be from the theme ( see QskLayoutEngineStyleInfo )

Code review 21-23.11
--------------------

Add auto-add-children property to QskTabBar

Making QskGradient into QGradient (i.e. exposing QGradient to QML)

Replace QSK_DLL with QSK_STATIC (or possibly remove it if not needed)

Add QML module for QskModule, find a way to not link directly to QtQML

Move relevant properties from QskAbstractButton to QskPushButton (checkable, isChecked)

Hide classes inherited from QskAnimation


Focus indicator: missing focus hints

Move QskImage to an example

Polish QskLineEdit & remove line edit example

QskIndexedLayout: equal width for all horizontal elements

Create skins as plugins; add squiek plugin as static plugin; use Q_IMPORT_PLUGIN for the examples (including Material)

Create playground directory for less-polished test examples

Finish slider API by introducing remaining pieces from QSlider ( inverted, inverted controls etc )

Add a cross-fade feature to QskWindow which freezes the frame and fades it out over an interval

qvg compiler only is built and run on the host

QskWindow: Add convenience methods for controlling resizing and preventing
window visibility until first frame is rendered

QskListBox: make the text geometry calculation numerically stable ( see result with a million items )

Add additional connection overloads to QskShortcut (see QTimer for inspiration)

Add a "Tab" QML type which is simply a QML wrapper for QskTabButton to form a QQC1-compatible API


Other stuff
--------------------

QskGridBox needs to have a mode for static grids ( reserving space for potential gaps )

something like QskControl::setClipRect could be implemented on the scene graph
level to make certain animations like in dcugui possible without introducing an extra item

State specific animators ( animators being related to the target state, what is
not exactly the perfect solution what would be related to transitions ( Moore vs. Mealy )
